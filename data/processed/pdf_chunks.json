A school that does not receive Title I funding in a school year does not have a \nfederal status in that year. Schools receiving Title I funds that are not in good standing must provide school choice for their students; \nthose in need of improvement year 2 and beyond must also provide Supplemental Education Services to eligible students. Other \nconsequences for schools not in good standing can be found at: www.emsc.nysed.gov/deputy/nclb/accountability/siinfo.htm. To \nbe removed from any improvement status, a school must make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in the grade and subject for which it \nwas identified for two consecutive years, or in the case of a School Under Registration Review, achieve the performance targets \nestablished for the school by the Commissioner. \nSchool in Good Standing: A school is considered to be in \ngood standing if it has not been identified as a School in Need \nof Improvement, Requiring Corrective Action, Planning for \nRestructuring, or Requiring Academic Progress, or as a \nSchool Under Registration Review. \nSchool Requiring Academic Progress: Under the State \ncomponent of New York\u2019s accountability system, a school that \ndoes not make AYP in the same grade and subject for two \nconsecutive years is considered a School Requiring Academic \nProgress (Year 1) for the following year. In each succeeding \nyear that the school fails to make AYP, the year designation is \nincremented by one. \nSchool in Need of Improvement (Year 1):  A school that has \nnot made AYP for two consecutive years in the same grade \nand subject while receiving Title I funds is considered a School \nin Need of Improvement (Year 1) for the following year. \nSchool in Need of Improvement (Year 2):  A School in Need \nof Improvement (Year 1) that does not make AYP in the grade \nand subject for which it was identified while receiving Title I \nfunds is considered a School in Need of Improvement (Year 2) \nfor the following year.  \nSchool Requiring Corrective Action: A School in Need of \nImprovement (Year 2) that does not make AYP in the grade \nand subject for which it was identified while receiving Title I \nfunds is considered a School Requiring Corrective Action for \nthe following year.  \nSchool Planning for Restructuring:  A School Requiring \nCorrective Action that does not make AYP in the grade and \nsubject for which it was identified while receiving Title I funds \nis considered a School Planning for Restructuring for the \nfollowing year.  \nSchool Restructuring:  A School Planning for Restructuring \nthat does not make AYP in the grade and subject for which it \nwas identified while receiving Title I funds is considered a \nSchool Restructuring for the following year. \nSchool Under Registration Review (SURR):  Schools that \nare farthest from the State standard and that have been \ndetermined by the Commissioner to be most in need of \nimprovement are Schools Under Registration Review.  These \nschools must achieve performance targets specified by the \nCommissioner of Education in their area(s) of identification \nwithin a prescribed timeframe or risk having their registration \nrevoked by the Board of Regents. \n"}, {"chunk_id": "b8b3fdeb-8add-4c81-a470-e6ce3f89bc34", "source": "pdf", "doc_path": "../data/raw/pdf/PM77VVIRKCVEFG6KFQWCC5LHTB5BY5FD.pdf", "loc": {"page": 3}, "text": "OAK STREET SCHOOL \n03/06/05 \n091200010004 \n \nElementary-Level English Language Arts  \nDefinitions of terms, such as Performance Index and Effective Annual \nMeasurable Objective (AMO), are in the glossary, which is the last page \nof this report. \nFor a school or a district to make Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) \nin 2003\u201304, every accountability group must make. \nFor an accountability group to make AYP in 2003\u201304, it must  \n1. meet the 95 percent participation requirement (2003\u201304 \nParticipation), and  \n2. either meet its Effective AMO or make safe harbor (2003\u201304 \nPerformance and Standards).  \nTo meet the participation requirement, 95 percent of the grade 4 \nenrollment in each accountability group with 40 or more students must \nbe tested.

Students who \ntransferred to programs leading to a high school diploma or high school \nequivalency diploma were not included in the 2000 school accountability \ncohort. The 2000 district accountability cohort consists of all students in each \nschool accountability cohort plus students who transferred within the district \nafter BEDS day plus students who were placed outside the district by the \nCSE or district administrators and who met the other requirements for cohort \nmembership. Cohort is defined in Section 100.2 (p) (8) of the \nCommissioner\u2019s Regulations. \nAdequate Yearly Progress (AYP):  Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) \nindicates satisfactory progress by a district or a school toward the goal of \nproficiency for all students.  \nAnnual Measurable Objective (AMO): The Annual Measurable Objective \n(AMO) is the PI value that signifies that an accountability group is making \nsatisfactory progress toward the goal that 100 percent of students will be \nproficient in the State's learning standards for English language arts and \nmathematics by 2013\u201314. The AMO will be increased in regular increments \nbeginning in 2004\u201305 until it reaches 200 in 2013\u201314.  (See Effective AMO \nfor further information.) \nContinuously Enrolled Students:  Students enrolled in the school or district \non BEDS day (usually the first Wednesday in October) of the school year and \nuntil the day of testing. \nEffective Annual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO):  The Effective \nAnnual Measurable Objective (Effective AMO) is the PI value that each \naccountability group within a school or district is expected to achieve to make \nAYP. The Effective AMO is the lowest PI that an accountability group of a \ngiven size can achieve in a subject for the group\u2019s PI not to be considered \nsignificantly different from the AMO for that subject. If an accountability \ngroup's PI equals or exceeds the Effective AMO, it is considered to have \nmade AYP.  A more complete definition of Effective AMO and a table \nshowing the PI values that each group size must equal or exceed to make \nAYP are available at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts. \nGraduation-Rate Cohort: Graduation-rate cohort for each year includes all \nstudents in the accountability cohort in the previous year plus all students \nexcluded from that accountability cohort solely because they transferred to a \ngeneral education development (GED) program. Certain students with \nsevere disabilities and new immigrants were excluded from the 1999 \ngraduation-rate cohort. \nGraduation-Rate Standard: The criterion value that represents a minimally \nsatisfactory percentage of cohort members earning a local diploma. The \nState Graduation-Rate Standard is 55 percent. The Commissioner may raise \nthe Graduation-Rate Standard at his discretion in future years. \nPerformance Index (PI):  A Performance Index is a value from 0 to 200 that \nis assigned to an accountability group, indicating how that group performed \non a required State test (or approved alternative) in English language arts, \nmathematics, or science. Student scores on the tests are converted to four \nachievement levels, from Level 1 (indicating no proficiency) to Level 4 \n(indicating advanced proficiency). At the elementary and middle levels, the \nPI is calculated using the following equation: 100 \u00d7 [(Count of \nContinuously Enrolled Tested Students Performing at Levels 2, 3, and 4 \n+ the Count at Levels 3 and 4) \u00f7 Count of All Continuously Enrolled \nTested Students]. At the secondary level, the PI is calculated using the \nfollowing equation: 100 \u00d7 [(Count of Cohort Members Performing at \nLevels 2, 3, and 4 + the Count at Levels 3 and 4) \u00f7 Count of All Cohort \nMembers].  A list of tests used to measure student performance for \naccountability is available at www.emsc.nysed.gov/irts. \nProgress Target: For accountability groups below the State Standard in \nscience or graduation rate, the Progress Target is an alternative method for \nmaking AYP or qualifying for safe harbor in English language arts and \nmathematics based on improvement over the previous year's performance.  \nSafe Harbor:  Safe Harbor provides an alternative means to demonstrate \nAYP for accountability groups that do not achieve their Effective AMOs in \nEnglish or mathematics.  \nScience Standard: The criterion value that represents a minimally \nsatisfactory performance in science. In 2003\u201304, the State Science Standard \nat the elementary and middle levels was a PI of 100. The Commissioner may \nraise the State Science Standard at his discretion in future years.\n \n"}, {"chunk_id": "fd471b7f-4f97-4068-95e3-eca1df0bcaad", "source": "pdf", "doc_path": "../data/raw/pdf/MZRWQI7HD6SSDT2AQTG7FN73WTASIU6X.pdf", "loc": {"page": 1}, "text": "990216FIS_Sm1.wpd\nMINUTES\nMONTANA SENATE\n56th LEGISLATURE - REGULAR SESSION\nCOMMITTEE ON FISH AND GAME\nCall to Order:  By CHAIRMAN KEN MESAROS, on February 16, 1999 at\n3:00 P.M., in Room 325 Capitol.\nROLL CALL\nMembers Present:\nSen.

Robin\nCunningham replied the population of outfitters that are allowed\nto participate on these rivers according to their operation plan\nwould be included in the population who must limit them\nindividually to two boats per site per day.  He said outfitters\ncould launch no more than two craft per site.  SENATOR DOHERTY\nasked if that was all outfitters or just each individual\noutfitter is limited to two launches per site per day.  Robin\nCunningham responded yes, each outfitter is limited to two. \nSENATOR DOHERTY asked how many sites are on the river that they\nare talking about that an outfitter would be able to launch from. \nRobin Cunningham stated on the Big Hole River there are probably\n15 sites yielding 30 craft per outfitter per day.\nSENATOR DOHERTY asked how many outfitters are licensed to do\nbusiness on the Big Hole and how many launches are they being\nlimited to compared to what is going on already.  Pat Graham\nreplied the department does not license outfitters so he could\nnot give the figures.  SENATOR DOHERTY asked if he knows how many\ncrafts are being launched per day during the season.  Pat Graham\nanswered somewhere between 7-8% of the use is outfitted.  He said\nhe could not translate that into an actual use figure but could\nget that information.  \nSENATOR DOHERTY said what he is was getting at is how much are\nthey really limiting, and if they are really limiting anything at\nall.  Pat Graham replied he understands his point but doesn't\nhave the information to tell him.\nSENATOR WELLS stated the amendment Mr. Cunningham proposed,\nlimits the access for the areas from Jerry Creek down to Salmon\nFly.  He asked how much of the river is being left for the\nsportsman fisherman.  Robin Cunningham said it is more\nappropriate for a local outfitter to answer the question.  Stuart\nDecker replied Jerry Creek to Melrose represents about 35-40\nmiles with 5 access sites.  He said of the section of the river\nthat is considered fishable represents the gut of the best and\nhas special regulations in place.  Historically, this is where\nmost of people give their attention when they go fishing.  That\nis where the most pressure is.  He said Jerry Creek down to\nMelrose represents probably 70% of the traffic any given day.\nSENATOR WELLS asked about the section on the Beaverhead River\nfrom Clark Canyon to Hannonberry.  Monty Hankinson stated on the\nBeaverhead from the dam to Hannonberry there are three major\naccesses which cover the first 5-6 miles of the river.

Monty Hankinson replied that\nis the most popular area.  He said on any tail water, the first\nfew miles below the dam are always the top fishing and most\npopular area.\nSENATOR TAYLOR asked how many outfitters are on the river on a\ngiven day and how many boats go down the river.  Stuart Decker\nsaid that is a moving target.  He asked Senator Taylor if he is\nasking for outfitters who reside directly in the area or\noutfitters who use it habitually.  SENATOR TAYLOR stated he just\nwanted to know approximately.  Stuart Decker said seasonally it\nis very different.  On June 15 there may be 10, 15, 20 over a\ncourse of a 30-mile stretch and you could float that far in a\nday.  In September, 30 miles of river represents 6 days worth of\nfishing and there would be between 2 and 4 outfitters on a\nsection.  Anywhere from Divide to Melrose there would be 10 to 12\nboats being put in at Divide and 10 to go into Melrose.  \n{Tape : 1; Side : B; Approx.

SENATOR BISHOP asked about the Ruby River\nand the Madison River.  SENATOR SWYSGOOD said he didn't want to\nopen a can of worms on the Madison and he is not as familiar with\nthat river.  He said it is a whole different situation.\nClosing by Sponsor:  \nSENATOR CHARLES SWYSGOOD, SD 17, Dillon said he has some real\nconcerns as it relates to the resource and the use of those\nresources.  He stated maybe everything we do isn't the panacea\nfor trying to correct everything.  He said they see some real\npotential for devastation of the resource.  He thinks that is why\nthe bill contains the section which allows them to address other\nuses of the river and allows them to establish a management plan\nfor all recreational uses of the river.  He said when it comes to\nlimiting use on the river by the outfitters, it is a difficult\nsituation to address, but if they do something similar to what is\nbeing suggested, then it couldn't get any worse than it is right\nnow.  He stated to remember a fishing outfitter files an\noperational plan and the outfitter lists the rivers he is going\nto use.  Any outfitter that has an operational plan on file, as\nof January 1, 1999 and lists the Beaverhead and the Big Hole,\nwould be part of the total picture.  He has concerns with some of\nthe amendments as to where they are going and the committee will\ndiscuss them during executive action.

He states \nSB 458 raises the bar and substantially penalizes a person that\nwould be convicted of purposely knowing or negligently taking,\nkilling or possessing or transporting a trophy animal.  He said\none important detail is the common hunter who makes a mistake.  \nThis bill has some serious fines for having these animals in\ntheir possession or taking them.  He said that is why they built\nin the language in page 3, line 9, subsection F which states what\nhe read before.  You must be convicted of purposely knowing or\nnegligent.  This is a high bar versus just having or being there. \nHe stated if the language is not satisfactory, then he is for\nimproving it.

He\nexplained how the Ruby River Task Force was established and what\ntheir objectives were.\nHe stated the Department of FWP requested an Attorney General's\nopinion regarding the issue of recreational access at bridges. \nThe opinion has not been forth coming from the Attorney General. \nHe believes the FWP does not have authority over county roads or\ncounty bridges, he thinks they rest with the Department of\nTransportation and/or the county governments.  The bill is to\ndiscuss this issue and to get an open and honest debate so they\ncan make some decisions on what the committee hears in the\nhearing.  He believes they have some valid arguments as it\nrelates to the use of bridge and road easements for access\nespecially across private property.  He said this legislation\ndoes not prevent access from any designated access site, any\nplace where the county or state owns the land adjacent to the\nwater course, any place where the right of way is held in fee\ntitle by the county or state, any place where the term of\neasement specifically allows access or any area where landowners\ngive permission for access.  He said the bill defines the\neasements on county roads and bridges as it relates to access of\nwhere private land is concerned.\nProponents' Testimony:  \nPage Dringman, MT Landowners Alliance, entered a pamphlet with\naccess sites and letters from counties, EXHIBIT(fis38a11), and\nletters from residents who could not be present,\nEXHIBIT(fis38a12).

She said landowners have also\nbeen concerned with the FWP request because the FWP asked for a\nbroad right of access that is correlated to the recreational use\nof streams statutes.  The FWP request to the Attorney General and\nthe landowners' concerns were discussed.\nPage Dringman said the FWP argument in the memorandum is the\npublic right of recreating in water courses between the high\nwater marks is justification for a right of access.  Mrs.\nDringman stated the argument uses the public trust doctrine which\nhas always been a judicial doctrine addressing water born uses as\na land use tool to restrict private property rights.  On the\nstream access law,  the law does not provide a right of access\nfrom dry land above the high water mark.  \nPage Dringman also commented on the numerous misrepresentations\nin the newspapers and the testimony given by the sponsor.  She\nsaid the bill does not prohibit access where there is public land\nor where there the road or bridge is held in fee by the county or\nstate.  \nThe pamphlet was explained and handed in the Montana Afloat map,\nEXHIBIT(fis38a13).  Mrs. Dringman said the issue before the\ncommittee concerns the scope of the easement that was given to\nthe county or the state Department of Transportation.  She\ncommented on court cases that have determined the scope of the\neasement and on bills in the current legislature.  She also\ncommented on the noxious weed bill and how noxious weeds are\nbeing spread and prevention of spread.\nPage Dringman clarified that private property rights are a\nfundamental right; there are constitutionally protected rights\nand it has to be balanced with the right of recreation.  She\nmentioned the court case of Garrison v Avral.  Comments on the\nenvironmental degradation and stream bank erosion were\nconsidered.  On her talk with the Department of Transportation,\nthey don't believe their highway easements for the highway\npurpose encompasses recreational use.  Letters from the counties\nwere discussed. \nPage Dringman stated the passage of SB 418 doesn't prevent\nfishing access site acquisition and negotiations but does say we\nrecognize a difference between an easement and fee title.    \n{Tape : 2; Side : A; Approx.

SENATOR BECK stated he thinks here are\nproblems on all bridges and there are some bridges that should be\naccess sites but may not all bridges.  In the drawing by Mr.\nHolden, he can't see where anyone would park a vehicle.

He asked\nif the bridge is 40 feet wide and the right of way is 60 feet\nwide.  Mrs. Dringman replied if there is an existing easement\nthat specifies the width of the right at the bridge then that\ndocument should control, so, if that is unclear then the bill\ncould be amended to address that.  She said this came about\nbecause the existing statutes say the width of all county roads\nexcept bridges, alleys and lanes must be 60 feet.  She said the\nDepartment of Transportation and county's concerns is if they\nwill be able to maintain the underlying structures but often the\nbridge easement doesn't specify.\nSENATOR BECK asked Mr. Graham what kind of ruling are they asking\nfor from the Attorney General.  Pat Graham said the chief legal\ncouncil was present who prepared the request and he could answer\nthe question.

They realized an\nanswer would not solve all of the circumstances but felt many of\nthem could be answered with his opinion based on case law and the\nConstitution.  They asked the Attorney General to answer as much\nas he felt he could about access at bridge crossings.    \nSENATOR BECK asked if they included interstates, secondary roads,\nprimary roads, not just county roads.  Bob Lane responded he\nbelieves they asked for access at county roads but the same\nprinciples would apply also to state right-of-ways.  He said\nessentially they were dealing with issues along the Ruby River\nand county roads there.  SENATOR BECK asked if it was strictly\nfor county roads.  \nSENATOR MESAROS stated if Mr. Lane could submit information of\nthe request to the committee it would be helpful.\nSENATOR TAYLOR said there is a concern with the public's lack of\nrespect for property rights as mentioned by the people.

He thinks they\ncan be handled by prosecutions for trespass or littering.  He\nthinks they can be handled by some restrictions on access.  He\nsaid they recognize that there are police powers to the state\nthat can control that and set limits on it.  \n"}, {"chunk_id": "e324ae7b-a441-4481-80ce-a5cc251aebd5", "source": "pdf", "doc_path": "../data/raw/pdf/MZRWQI7HD6SSDT2AQTG7FN73WTASIU6X.pdf", "loc": {"page": 19}, "text": "SENATE COMMITTEE ON FISH AND GAME\nFebruary 16, 1999\nPAGE 19 of 21\n990216FIS_Sm1.wpd\nSENATOR MESAROS stated he would like a copy of the request\nsubmitted to the committee.  He said there is a big difference\nbetween county roads and interstate.  He said in his district\nthere is a state highway and county roads going through private\nproperty and neither which a right of way has ever been\npurchased.  He said there is a lot of variation between means of\nacquiring right of ways for public roads.  \nBob Lane said the question they asked was \"may a member of the\nrecreating public gain access from the right of way of a public\nroad at a bridge crossing to a stream or river between the\nordinary high water marks.  He said their question was broad from\na public road which could include state roads or county roads. \nHe recognized one opinion will not solve all problems.  \nClosing by Sponsor:  \n{Tape : 3; Side : A; Approx. Time Counter : 0}\nSENATOR CHARLES SWYSGOOD, SD 17, Dillon, said he thinks the issue\nwas brought to the committee for a good reason.  He said the\nAttorney General has had the request for 8 months and has not\nrendered a decision.  He doesn't know if an answer is coming.  He\nsaid he doesn't know it says anywhere that the legislature can't\nbring forth an issue to be discussed and be decided by the body\nas it relates to anything they do.  He said it would be nice to\nhave an answer and that is what the bill attempts to do.  He\nstated the role of the FWP is to manage wildlife and fish for the\nrecreating public and for the public well being, and to provide\nrecreation opportunities for all Montanans.  He wonders if that\nmeans expanding a definition or a use, such as an easement to fit\nthat purpose, that is what the committee is going to decide.  He\nsaid in most incidents there isn't much management that is a\nresponsibility of the FWP at many of the bridge sites unless it\nis a specified access site.\nHe doesn't think the committee, by passing the judicial\nauthority, is addressing the concerns that the bill brings\nforward.  He commented about the question the FWP asked the\nAttorney General.\nHe said county roads are where the problem exists.  He said some\nroad right of way, particularly state highways, are mostly held\nin fee title however the interest held in most road right-of-ways\nparticularly county roads are an easement, not fee title.  \nHe read  section 7, 142107.  He said the ownership of the\neasement interest rather than the fee title limits and restricts\nappropriate use of public road right-of-ways.  He commented there\nare a variety of ways in which a road can be created and to\n"}, {"chunk_id": "813c49c0-bca2-4851-8231-2a40689bb70a", "source": "pdf", "doc_path": "../data/raw/pdf/MZRWQI7HD6SSDT2AQTG7FN73WTASIU6X.pdf", "loc": {"page": 20}, "text": "SENATE COMMITTEE ON FISH AND GAME\nFebruary 16, 1999\nPAGE 20 of 21\n990216FIS_Sm1.wpd\ndetermine the width for any easement or fee.
